## ex:2 Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## Aim:
To design a basic mobile and web layout for an existing case study by applying Gestalt principles, incorporating UI design patterns, developing interaction behaviors for usability, and creating a branded logo using Canva in alignment with design guidelines.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Select a Case Study Choose an existing digital product (e.g., Zomato, Airbnb, Amazon). Analyze its core features, target users, and branding style.

Step 2: Apply Gestalt Design Principles Apply key principles like: Proximity – group related items together. Similarity – use consistent colors, icons, fonts. Continuity – guide the user's eyes through layout flow. Closure – allow users to perceive incomplete shapes. Figure-Ground – differentiate elements from the background.

Step 3: Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes Sketch basic layout ideas for both mobile and web versions. Use pen-paper or tools like Balsamiq/Figma for rough structure. Focus on navigation, spacing, grouping of elements.

Step 4: Incorporate UI Elements and Design Patterns Add components like: Buttons, search bars, cards, modals, navigation drawers. Apply UI design patterns: Hamburger menu (mobile) Top navigation (web) Infinite scroll or pagination Ensure visual hierarchy and consistency.

Step 5: Develop Interaction & Usability Behaviors Define key user flows (e.g., sign-in, product browsing, checkout). Ensure interactions follow usability principles: Feedback on actions (e.g., button pressed, error shown) Accessibility (contrast, font size, touch target size) Minimal user effort and cognitive load

Step 6: Create a Brand Logo Using Canva Open Canva and select logo template. Choose appropriate font, colors, and iconography aligned with the brand's tone. Export the logo in PNG format. Place the logo into both mobile and web layouts for brand consistency.

Step 7: Build Final Layouts Use Figma, Adobe XD, or similar tools to create high-fidelity layouts. Design both mobile and web versions based on the same design system. Insert the brand logo and ensure responsiveness in design elements.

Step 8: Review and Test Present designs to peers or users. Collect feedback on layout clarity, branding, and usability. Refine layouts based on suggestions.
